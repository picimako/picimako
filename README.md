#### Welcome Dear Visitor!

I create plugins for JetBrains products based on the IntelliJ Platform. I have more than a decade experience in QA and test automation, so my main focus is on test automation related libraries.

Beside the current projects I maintain, there are others too in the making for various test automation related libraries, and potentially for game modding.
