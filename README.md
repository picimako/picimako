Welcome Dear Visitor!

I create plugins for JetBrains products based on the IntelliJ Platform. I have more than a decade experience in QA and test automation, so my main focus when creating plugins, is test automation related libraries.

Beside the current projects I maintain, there are others too in the making for various test automation related libraries.

You can find them on the JetBrains Martketplace as well:

[Mockitools](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18117-mockitools) / [Gherkin Overview](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16716-gherkin-overview) / [Terra Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15430-terra-support) / [JBehave Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7268-jbehave-support) (I joined the group of authors)
