Welcome Dear Visitor!

I create plugins for JetBrains products and the IntelliJ Platform. I have more than a decade experience in QA and test automation, so my main focus when creating plugins, is test automation related libraries.

Besides the current projects I maintain, there are a couple of them in the planning or implementation phase for various test automation libraries.
