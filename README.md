#### Welcome Dear Visitor!

I create plugins for JetBrains products based on the IntelliJ Platform. I have more than a decade experience in QA and test automation, so my main focus is on test automation related libraries.

Beside the current projects I maintain, I also offer IDE plugin development and consultation services. If you are interested, you can contact me via one of the ways below.
